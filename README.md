# Cyborg Platformer Game

This is a zombie shooter platformer demo game created as a college project in my first year. Built entirely from scratch using **Java Swing**—no external libraries, game engines, or external assistance involved. All physics, mechanics, and features were hand-coded based on intuition when I was starting to code, so please don’t judge too harshly!

In the game, you navigate a level, avoiding obstacles and zombies and tracking your score. It features:

- **Physics-Based Movement**: Simple gravity and collision detection mechanics made by hand.
- **Zombie Shooter**: Engage with enemies while platforming through the levels.
- **HUD**: Displays health, score, attempts, and a timer.
- **Dynamic Level Loading**: Levels are loaded from a text file, where each character represents a different platform or object type.

All sprites are from [CraftPix](https://craftpix.net/freebies/). Big thanks to them for providing these awesome assets for free!

To play, ensure all required image files are organized in the `src` directory as per the setup instructions, and launch the game by running `CyborgPlatform.java`. Enjoy surviving the zombie-infested platforms!
